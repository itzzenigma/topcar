        <img src="https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/99-koenigsegg-cc8s.jpg" alt="Koenigsegg CC8S">
        <p><big>The Koenigsegg CC8S, introduced in 2002, was the first production car from Koenigsegg and a significant milestone in the world of hypercars. This groundbreaking model demonstrated Koenigsegg’s commitment to high-performance engineering and innovative design. With its striking appearance and advanced technology, the CC8S quickly made a name for itself among automotive enthusiasts.</big></p>
        <p><big>Powered by a 4.7-liter V8 engine producing 655 horsepower, the CC8S was capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph (0 to 100 km/h) in just 3.5 seconds. The car’s lightweight carbon fiber construction and aerodynamic design contributed to its impressive performance, with a top speed exceeding 240 mph (386 km/h). The CC8S’s advanced engineering also included features such as an innovative carbon fiber monocoque chassis and a highly tuned suspension system.</big></p>
        <p><big>Inside, the CC8S offered a driver-focused cockpit with high-quality materials and a minimalist design, reflecting its performance-oriented nature. While its interior was relatively spartan compared to more modern hypercars, it provided a raw and exhilarating driving experience that appealed to purists.</big></p>
